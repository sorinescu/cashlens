Overview
========

CashLens is an Android 2.1+ application that allows you to track your expenses in a simple way, by taking pictures of items you bought.

Features
========

* add expense by specifying the amount, account and currency and either taking a picture of an item (bought object, receipt, bill etc) or specifying a text description, or both
* multiple expense accounts, with configurable currencies
* predefined filters: this day, current week, current month
* custom start of month for each account (e.g. for credit cards); the "current month" filter will show expenses starting from each account's configured start of month
