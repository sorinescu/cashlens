CashLens is an Android 2.1+ application that allows you to track your expenses in a simple way, by taking pictures of items you bought.

Some features:
* add expense by specifying the amount, account and currency and taking a picture of an item (bought object, receipt, bill etc)
* multiple expense accounts, with configurable currencies
* filter expenses by start/end date, account, currency
* predefined filters: this day, current week, current month
* custom start of month for each account (e.g. for credit cards); the "current month" filter will show expenses starting from each account's configured start of month
* custom filters: one or more accounts, optional start and end date

Future plans:
* customizable expense list text appearance
* automatic currency exchange rate
* "audio expenses" (record an audio message instead of / in addition to taking a picture)
* recurring payments (with calendar integration)
* Excel/Google Docs export
* automatic text recognition (bills, receipts)
